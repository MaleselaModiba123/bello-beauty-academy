# Software Architecture Document : Bello Beauty Academy Platform

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** May 2026
**Status:** Updated — Assignment 12

## Project Title

**Bello Beauty Academy Platform**

*A professional web-based management system for the Bello Beauty Academy, offering certified training courses in lash artistry, brow techniques, nail technology, and makeup artistry.*

---

## Domain

The Bello Beauty Academy Platform operates within the **Beauty Education and Professional Training** domain. Beauty academies are educational institutions focused exclusively on training aspiring beauty professionals. Unlike beauty salons or spas that deliver services to end customers, beauty academies provide structured certification programs covering lash artistry, brow techniques, nail technology, and makeup artistry. Students enroll in formal training programs, learn practical techniques under qualified trainers, and earn recognised industry certifications upon successful completion.

The domain is characterised by a need to manage students, trainers, courses, class schedules, practical assessments, and certification records, all of which require a purpose-built digital management platform to replace the manual and informal processes currently in use.

---

## Problem Statement

The Bello Beauty Academy currently manages its training operations through a combination of manual processes, spreadsheets, and informal communication channels such as WhatsApp and phone calls. This approach results in inefficient student enrollment, uncoordinated class scheduling, incomplete progress records, manual certificate issuance, and a lack of operational visibility for management. The Bello Beauty Academy Platform is proposed as a web-based management system that will resolve these challenges by digitising and automating the core operations of the academy.

---

## Individual Scope

The core features: student enrollment, course management, trainer management, class scheduling, progress tracking, payment confirmation, and certificate generation form a complete and cohesive system that addresses all the identified problems. Complex features such as online card payment processing and live virtual classes have been deliberately deferred to future releases and documented in the Future Scope section of the specification. The system is built using widely adopted technologies (React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL) that are well documented and supported, making the implementation feasible within the project timeline.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The **Bello Beauty Academy Platform** is designed as a modern, **layered web application** following a client-server model. The system separates concerns clearly across the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data layer. This separation ensures that each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

The architecture prioritises:

- **Separation of Concerns** — the frontend, backend API, and database are independently deployable units
- **Role-Based Access Control** — each user role (Student, Trainer, Administrator) has strictly scoped access
- **Service Isolation** — specialised functions such as payment tracking, certificate generation, and email notifications are handled by dedicated services
- **Scalability** — the containerised deployment model supports horizontal scaling
- **Security** — all inter-service communication is authenticated and encrypted

---

## 2. Architecture Style

The system adopts a **modular monolith backend** architecture for this first version. The backend API is structured as a single deployable application with clearly separated internal modules. This approach keeps the codebase maintainable and can be evolved into microservices in future iterations.

**Architecture pattern:** Layered MVC (Model-View-Controller) with service layer
**API style:** RESTful HTTP API

---

## 3. System Components

### 4.1 Frontend Web Application

A **React.js Single Page Application (SPA)** that provides the user interface for all three user roles — Students, Trainers, and Administrators. The frontend communicates with the backend exclusively via the REST API over HTTPS. It renders role-specific dashboards and views based on the authenticated user's role, including a proof of payment upload form and a payment status view.

### 4.2 Backend REST API

A **Node.js + Express.js** application serving as the core of the system. All business logic is organised into the following internal modules:

- **User Management Module** — registration, login, and profile management
- **Course Management Module** — CRUD operations for courses and categories
- **Student Enrollment Module** — enrollment lifecycle management; blocks course access until payment is confirmed
- **Payment Management Module** — tracks payment status, handles proof of payment uploads, and supports admin manual confirmation for cash and EFT payments
- **Schedule Management Module** — training session scheduling and trainer assignment
- **Progress Tracking Module** — attendance and competency assessment records
- **Certificate Generation Module** — PDF certificate generation and issuance
- **Notification Module** — transactional email dispatch

### 4.3 Database

A **PostgreSQL** relational database persisting all system data: users, courses, enrollments, payments, sessions, attendance, assessments, certificates, and course materials.

### 4.4 Authentication Service

A **JWT-based authentication service** embedded in the backend. Handles registration, login, password hashing (bcrypt), token issuance, token validation, and role-based access enforcement on every protected API endpoint.

### 4.5 Payment Management Service

A dedicated internal service managing all payment-related operations. The student uploads a proof of payment document after making payment. The administrator reviews it on the payment dashboard and confirms or rejects it. On confirmation, the enrollment is automatically activated and the student receives an email notification.

### 4.6 Certificate Generation Service

A **PDF generation service** using Puppeteer or PDFKit. Generates branded PDF certificates containing the student's name, course name, completion date, and a unique certificate number.

### 4.7 Notification Service

An **email notification service** using NodeMailer and SendGrid. Dispatches enrollment confirmations, payment notifications, schedule updates, and certificate ready alerts.

## 11. API Documentation — Swagger UI

The REST API is fully documented using OpenAPI 3.0 and Springdoc OpenAPI. Once the application is running, the full interactive API documentation is available at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

The raw OpenAPI specification is available at `docs/openapi.yaml`.

### Overview — All Controllers

The Swagger UI shows all three controllers with their endpoints: student-controller, enrollment-controller, and course-controller.
